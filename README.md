# pinterest-prd
 I created a Pinterest PRD focused on providing analytics visibility for the past 7, 30, and 90 days. While Bolt's initial implementation was solid, a few issues emerged: the inability to export data, the absence of a scheduling feature for report distribution, and a glitch where data did not update when switching between date ranges. To address these, I queried Bolt to implement data export, enable report scheduling, and ensure accurate updates based on the selected time frames.

Bolt successfully integrated the export functionality, scheduling features, and key analytics/KPIs. However, I noticed that active campaigns and popular pins were still not updating correctly with the date range changes. After highlighting this issue, Bolt made additional adjustments, and after a few iterations, the problem was resolved.

For your reference, I have included the PRD, exported file, screenshots demonstrating data updates across various date ranges, and the “schedule reports” feature, all attached to this submission.
